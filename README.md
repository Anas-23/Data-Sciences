## [P1-House Price Prediction](https://github.com/Anas-23/Portfolio/blob/main/P1-House%20pricing.ipynb)
Dataset : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview

This is my first project to learn data science. Before doing this task, i complete some course in kaggle. I do some step to complete this project.
##### Overview Data
Understanding Description each columns
##### EDA
Understanding numerical and categorical columns such as outliers, data distribution, data consistency, multicollinearity, etc.
#### Data Preprocessing
For data preprocessing, i do data preprocessing like drop column with high multicolinearity, handle missing value, standardization, etc.
#### Model and Evaluation
I use some models and evalauted model for find best model based on metrics evaluation.
#### Prediction and Submission
Create prediction using best model and make submission file.

#### Insight
1. Overall quality is most correlated with data target (price).
2. Model Lasso has best MAE value : 13687.
